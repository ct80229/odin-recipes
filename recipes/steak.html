<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p>Begin by trussing your filet mignon cut (see episode for how-to), then salt liberally with kosher salt and black pepper. Place in the fridge for 24 hours.</p></li>
    <li><p>Heat some vegetable oil in a stainless steel roaster until it just starts to smoke and then drop the beef inside. Let it sit for a solid 2-3 minutes to develop some good color on the outside. Flip and sear on the other side.</p></li>
    <li><p>Insert temperature probe into the beef and place in a 450°F oven.</p></li>
    <li><p>While beef is in the oven, place some cippolini onions into a bowl and place in the microwave for 1 minute. Toss them in some vegetable oil and then add them to a preheated baking sheet. Place in the oven for a few minutes and flip once they get brown and return to oven for a few more minutes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Remove tenderloin from the oven after 20-25 minutes, or once the internal steak temperature is 115°F. Let rest for at least 10 minutes.</p></li>
    <li><p>To the roaster pan, add grated shallots, ¼ cup of chicken stock and ¼ cup of red wine then boil it down to a syrup consistency. Turn off the heat and add 1 Tbsp of butter. Whisk together and you’ve got a pan sauce.</p></li>
    <li><p>Plate with cippolini onions and pan sauce. Serve and enjoy.</p></li>
